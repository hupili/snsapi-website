## What's New

### 20121019. We are under intensive reconstruction!

For those who want to catch up with the latest progress, 
please checkout the	`dev` branch!

We are under intensive reconstruction and it's almost done. 

Two new platforms are enabled:

   * SQLite. 
   * TwitterStatus

They are in the `plugin_trial` directory. 
So you have to enable trial plugin first. 
Please see `snsapi/platform.py` for the instructions of 
how to enable trial plugins. 

### 20120928. The blog site is up. 

Everyone can add a blog post using Github. Just fork the 
[snsapi-website](https://github.com/hupili/snsapi-website)
repository, add you articles there and issue a pull request.
We appreciate well-written posts on any related topic. e.g. 
Why SNSAPI is important; 
Your (probably) bad experience with current SNSs; 
What's your experience with SNSAPI;
The vista you'd like to share regarding 
Decentralised Social Network, Federated Social Network, etc. 
Of course, constructive criticisms are also highly appreciated. 
e.g. How the codes should be improved;
How to design a better framework;
This project is re-inventing wheels -- point us to the priors, etc. 

### 20120927. We handled the first pull request on Github. 

It's a good first step towards community driven project!

### 20120927. News page is setup.
