We seek candidates for both the System development and Algorithm Design tracks. 
The specific tasks will be determined based on discussions with the candidates. 
Candidates are also encouraged to send us their own proposals related to our current project directions.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: What's the quota of interns/RAs to this program?

**A**:
We have multiple openings. 
If there are many highly motivated and technically strong applicants, 
we may offer more intern/RA positions. 
The exact number depends on the applicants we have. 

#### Q: What's the type, language and requirements of interview? 

**A**:
All interviews are via video phone services,
e.g. Skype, gTalk, etc.
Please get at least one channel ready before the interview.
We'll appoint a time with you via emails.
[Pili](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~hpl011/homepage/)
will conduct a first round interview and pass 10-15 candidates to
[prof. Lau](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~wclau/).
1st round can be conducted in Mandarin or English. 
2nd round will be in English. 
For the 1st round, only mandatory requirement is registration on
[Google form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dEZaT2xQRldQaW12ekZ6dVVVU2puTFE6MQ).
Pili will use the information to trace your participation in the open source projects.
Candidates for the 2nd round **must** submit a CV;
He/she can optionally submit PS or RP to give more information.

#### Q: I'm not technically strong at the moment. Do I have any chance?

**A**:

Firstly, you have about one month to get technically prepared. 
Python is easy to learn and use. 
Please stay with our community via Google group or Github. 
With the help of community members, 
you will soon self-learn everything that is needed if you spend the winter vocation wisely.

Secondly, besides the current summer intern/RA program, 
we have more forthcoming opportunities in the future winter/summer vocations. 
The selection strategy will be similar, i.e. open source project participation plus interview. 
The future project may not be SNSAPI. 
We will continuously open some components of our research projects, 
seek highly motivated and technically strong contributors, 
and invite them to hack together during the winter/summer vocations. 
Please stay tuned. 

#### Q: How much is paid one month? 

**A**:

We do not have exact number currently.
Basically, there are two channels to enroll students:

   * CUHK Mainland/Taiwan **undergraduate** summer intern program.
   Students come via this channel will be centrally accomodated by CUHK.
   Besides studying in our lab, the university also schedules other activities, 
   e.g. get-together with other summer intern of this kind, cultural tour in Hongkong, etc. 
   * Research Assistant of Mobitec/IE/CUHK.
   Students come via this channel will be paid by individual research grant.
   However, they shall plan the travel and living themselves. 

One take home message is that, 
no matter which channel you go, 
you don't have to worry about the expense. 
We'll ask your preference in the 2nd round of interview.
