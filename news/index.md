Everyone can add a blog post using Github. Just fork the

repository, add you articles there and issue a pull request.
We appreciate well-written posts on any related topic. e.g. 
Why SNSAPI is important; 
Your (probably) bad experience with current SNSs; 
What's your experience with SNSAPI;
The vista you'd like to share regarding 
Decentralised Social Network, Federated Social Network, etc. 
Of course, constructive criticisms are also highly appreciated. 
e.g. How the codes should be improved;
How to design a better framework;
This project is re-inventing wheels -- point us to the priors, etc.

It's a good first step towards community driven project!
