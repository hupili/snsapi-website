### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: What's the quota of interns/RAs to this program?

**A**:
We have multiple openings. 
If there are many highly motivated and technically strong applicants, 
we may offer more intern/RA positions. 
The exact number depends on the applicants we have. 

#### Q: What's the type, language and requirements of interview? 

**A**:
All interviews are via video phone services,
e.g. Skype, gTalk, etc.

We'll appoint a time with you via emails.
[Pili](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~hpl011/homepage/)
will conduct a first round interview and pass 10-15 candidates to
[prof. Lau](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~wclau/).

2nd round will be in English. 
For the 1st round, only mandatory requirement is registration on
[Google form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dEZaT2xQRldQaW12ekZ6dVVVU2puTFE6MQ).

**A**:

Firstly, you have about one month to get technically prepared. 
Python is easy to learn and use. 
Please stay with our community via Google group or Github. 
With the help of community members, 
you will soon self-learn everything that is needed if you spend the winter vocation wisely.

Secondly, besides the current summer intern/RA program, 
we have more forthcoming opportunities in the future winter/summer vocations. 
The selection strategy will be similar, i.e. open source project participation plus interview. 
The future project may not be SNSAPI. 
We will continuously open some components of our research projects, 
seek highly motivated and technically strong contributors, 
and invite them to hack together during the winter/summer vocations. 
Please stay tuned. 

#### Q: How much is paid one month? 

**A**:

We do not have exact number currently.
Basically, there are two channels to enroll students:

   * CUHK Mainland/Taiwan **undergraduate** summer intern program.
   Students come via this channel will be centrally accomodated by CUHK.
   Besides studying in our lab, the university also schedules other activities, 
   e.g. get-together with other summer intern of this kind, cultural tour in Hongkong, etc. 
   * Research Assistant of Mobitec/IE/CUHK.
   Students come via this channel will be paid by individual research grant.
   However, they shall plan the travel and living themselves. 

One take home message is that, 
no matter which channel you go, 
you don't have to worry about the expense. 
We'll ask your preference in the 2nd round of interview.
